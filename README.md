# Word-Guess-Game
I was inspired by the "idea" of the game.  I was looking forward to really customizing it.  I started to style a page.  But, when it came time to do the javascript. I couldn't do it. There are many Hangman games out there. And I studied various tutorials, but thought I might have success with the "easier" project. That didn't work either.
